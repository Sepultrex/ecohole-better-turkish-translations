As I said, if we do not stop the portal, the world as we know it will end, humanity will be destroyed...
We have to stop the portal. The world as we know it is on the brink of destruction. We seem to be turning into monsters, but so far neither of us has lost their mind.

The portal is closed, I retained the sanity... Undoubtedly, soon people will start looking for a medicine that can reverse the transformation.
There were some casualties, and I'm not talking about us. Humanity will have to heal the wounds from what happened for some time. And we cannot even imagine when we will be able to return home, to stay with people once again... We believe that people will soon start looking for a medicine that can reverse the transformation.
